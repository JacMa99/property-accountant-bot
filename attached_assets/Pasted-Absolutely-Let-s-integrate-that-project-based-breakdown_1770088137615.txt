Absolutely! Let’s integrate that project-based breakdown:

---

I want to develop an app, agent, or website for managing income and expenses from properties I manage and my grandmother’s household. Here’s the detailed breakdown:

1. **Income Tracking:**

   * Input bank statements (CSV) to track rental income.
   * Each income correlates to specific units. If tenant Edwin pays rent, it links to Edwin’s unit (e.g., Unit A1).
   * The app reconciles patterns (e.g., double payments for missed months).

2. **Expense Tracking – Two Categories:**

   * Property expenses from the bank account (repairs, investments, employees) and grandmother expenses from her credit card (household costs).
   * Each expense links to a specific unit (e.g., Unit B2 repair) or general property or household.

3. **Projects & Line Items:**

   * I want to track large projects (e.g., installing security cameras) as umbrella expenses.
   * Within a project, I need to link multiple line-item expenses—e.g., equipment cost, software, installation, cash payments—whether detected from statements or added manually.
   * The project shows a total cost but allows drilling down into these detailed line items.

4. **Monthly Fixed vs. Variable Expenses:**

   * Define fixed monthly costs and track fluctuating expenses for both property and grandmother categories.

5. **Cash Payments & Reminders:**

   * Set reminders when making cash out-of-pocket payments. The app will prompt reconciliation at month’s end if these aren’t accounted for.

6. **Reconciliation & Checkmarks:**

   * The app reconciles expected patterns (e.g., expected rent or repeated expenses).
   * Checkmarks indicate reconciliation—whether detected from statements or based on manual input.

7. **High-Level Summary:**

   * Provide an overview each month:

     * Total property income (by unit/general).
     * Total property expenses (by unit/general).
     * Project expenses broken down by line items.
     * Grandmother expenses.
     * Net income or net loss.

8. **Functionality Recap:**

   * Inputs: Bank/credit card statements, manual inputs, project groupings.
   * Categorize by property vs. grandmother, specific units, or projects.
   * Reconcile patterns, track projects with detailed line items, and ensure overall clarity.
